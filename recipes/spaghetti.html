        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nona's spaghetti and meat sauce recipe takes just a few minutes of prep and then a low simmer on the stove for a deep, meaty-flavored, homemade spaghetti for the best family favorite dinner.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>Tomato paste</li>
            <li>Beef broth</li>
            <li>Mushrooms</li>
            <li>Red wine</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Celery</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Italian seasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Brown the beef</strong> - Drain off any excess fat, then, throw in the chopped celery, onion, and garlic and cook until the vegetables soften.</li>
            <li><strong>Boil and simmer</strong> - Dump the rest of the homemade pasta sauce ingredients into the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Once the spaghetti sauce is boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer on the stove for 3 hours. I know 3 hours sounds like forever, but that’s how long it takes to make a rich, flavorful meat sauce. Just do what the Italians do, (fuhgetaboutit).</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the noodles</strong> - Once the homemade spaghetti sauce has had time to simmer, all that’s left to do is boiling the spaghetti noodles according to package instructions and dish it up!</li>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong> - Plate noodles and add generous amount of sauce, garnished with parsley and parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ol>
